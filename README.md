This is an interactive prompt generator that uses Langchain to create more refined and contextualized prompts for language models.

To use the app, simply enter an initial prompt and the app will generate an improved prompt.

The app uses a set of predefined examples to create the improved prompt. These examples are selected based on their semantic similarity to the user's initial prompt.

The final, improved prompt is then displayed on the user interface.

Here are the steps on how to use the app:

1. Enter an initial prompt in the text area.
2. Click the "Generate Prompt" button.
3. The improved prompt will be displayed on the screen.

Here is an example of how the app works:

Initial prompt: "Write a story about a magical forest"

Improved prompt: "As an experienced fiction writer, craft a short story set in a magical forest.

The story should be aimed at children aged 8-12 and should include elements of adventure and mystery.

The magical forest should be vividly described, with unique flora and fauna. The main character encounters various challenges and magical creatures in the forest.

The story should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a resolution that imparts a moral lesson."

As you can see, the improved prompt is more detailed and contextualized than the initial prompt. It provides more information about the setting, characters, and plot of the story. This will help the language model to generate a more accurate and engaging output.

I hope you find this app helpful!
